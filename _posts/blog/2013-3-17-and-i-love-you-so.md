<div class="center"><img src="/images/2013/girl.png" style="border:none;width:280px;height:280px"></div>

<div style="width:150px;margin:0px auto;font-size:14px;overflow:hidden">
<span style="font-size:28px;color:black">A</span>nd I love you so<br/>
The people ask me how<br/>
How I live till now<br/>
I tell them I don't know<br/>
I guess they understand<br/>
How lonely life has been<br/>
But life began again<br/>
The day you took my hand<br/>
And yes I know how lonely life can be<br/>
The shadows follow me<br/>
And the night won't set me free<br/>
But I don't let the evening get me down<br/>
Now that you're around me<br/>
And you love me too<br/>
Your thoughts are just for me<br/>
You set my spirit free<br/>
I'm happy that you do<br/>
The book of life is brief<br/>
And once a page is read<br/>
All but love is dead<br/>
That is my belief<br/>
And yes I know how lonely life can be<br/>
The shadows follow me<br/>
And the night won't set me free<br/>
But I don't let the evening get me down<br/>
Now that you're around me<br/>
